            Hello there! <br><br>My name is <b>Frosina Milosevska</b> and I come from Makedonska Kamenica,
            Macedonia. I am currently a computer
            science student in Skopje. 2021/2022 was the first year of college for me,
            at the Faculty  of Computer Science and Engineering, majoring in <i>Software
            Engineering and Information Systems</i>. My previous education consists of Secondary school
            (called <i>gymnasium</i> in Macedonia) and primary school.

            My <b>favorite things to do</b> are: reading books, enjoying my fav music,
            exercising / running / going to gym, and having quality time with my friends.
            One of the things I especially love is having peaceful moments and enjoying
            my own company. But that doesn't mean that I don't want to be with my friends
            and share many laughs! This is actually one of my favorite things to do, and I
            always cherish it and look forward to it. Additionally, I am keen on visiting new
            places, discovering their culture and admiring their architecture.
