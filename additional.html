    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p class="paragraphs">
        I enjoy reading psychology and philosophy books, self-help books and classics. One of my favorite books
        is <strong>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</strong>, by <em>Yuval Noah</em>. In the books the
        author talks about our species, starting the story from the beginning of the human era, developing the
        story to the modern day Homo Sapiens. Additionally, i really enjoyed <em>Dostoevsky's</em> <strong>
        Crime and Punishment</strong>, <em>George Orwell's</em> <strong>
        Animal Farm</strong> and <strong>1984</strong>, <strong>A Mind For Numbers</strong> by
        <em>Barbara Oakley</em> and <strong>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</strong>, by
        <strong>Mark Manson</strong>.
        In terms of movies, some of my favorites are: <strong>The Eternal Sunshine of the
        Spotless Mind</strong>, <strong>Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood</strong>, <strong>Inglorious Basterds</strong>,
        <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong>, <strong>Inception</strong>...
        Speaking of music, I have a versatile style and genre that changes over time. Genres that tend to stay
        with me are <em>Alternative Rock</em> <em>Nu Rock</em>, <em>Progressive Rock</em> and <em>Indie</em>.
        According to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/" style="text-decoration: none">Spotify</a>, this is my summary:<br>
        Top artist: Pink Floyd<br>
        Top track: Down by the Water by PJ Harvey<br>
        Top sub-genre: Rock<br>
        Top decade: 2010s<br>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p class="paragraphs">I love sport and my favorite sport is basketball. I've played it for nearly 10 years, but I stopped
    some time ago. Now my favorite hobby is going to the gym or doing any other kind of physical activity.
    I also like  taking up online courses on EdX, Coursera and similar sites, to build up my knowledge
    for college.</p>
